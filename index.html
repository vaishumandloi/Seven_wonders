        <h3>Petra- Jordan</h3>
        <p>
         Petra is one of the oldest cities in the world. The name 'Petra' means 'Rocks'. Petra is fomous for its rock-cut 
         architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because
         of the colour of the stone from which it is carved. Petra is located in the southwestern corner of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordon.
         Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one 
         of the world's most famous archaeological sites, where ancient Eastern traditions blend with Hellenistic architecture.
         One of the most famous structures in Petra is Al Khazneh. It is a stone building that accommodated more than 20,000 people. At the
         beginning of the 8th century A.D., Petra was mostly abandoned and had lost its significance. Its unique architecture continues to make 
         it stand out and this caught the eye of archaeologists and historians.

        <h3>The Great Wall of Chine- Beijing, China</h3>
        <p>
         The Great Wall is the largest man-made project in the world. The complete route is over 20,000 km, stretching from 
         the east seaside to the west desert in northern China, winding up and down across mountains and plateaus like a dragon.
         It took over 2,000 years to construct the wall. The Great Wall is not a single-structured wall, it includes beacon towers, 
         barriers, barracks, garrison stations, and fortresses along the walls, together forming an integrated defense system.
         It is Chinese people's greatest cultural icon. The wall was built with stones and earth, a more important part of the construction was the glutinous rice.
         The sticky rice was used as the mortar due to its adhesive property. Studies have shown that the sticky substance of the rice is behind the endurance and 
         strength of the wall. The Great Wall of China is made up of 19 separate walls joined to form one massive wall that we know today because it is made by
         different-different provinces according to their convenience.

        <h3>Machu Picchu- Peru</h3>
        <p>
         Machu Picchu is more than 7,000 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains in Peru. In the Quechua Indian language, “Machu Picchu” means 
         “Old Peak” or “Old Mountain.” It is a symbol of the Incan Empire. Above Machu Picchu is a 'No-Fly' Zone. Each Stone which is used in Machu Picchu
         is cut so precisely that the most sacred constructions were built without the use of mortar. The structures were so well built with a technique called 
         Ashlar (stones that are cut to fit together without mortar) that not even a knife blade can fit in between stones. Although many of the stones that were 
         used to build the city were more than 50 pounds, it is believed that no wheels were used to transport these rocks up the mountain. Rather, it is thought 
         that hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side.
